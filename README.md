# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
To grow my professional skills in data analysis and have the necessary tool to develop my professional path into software engineering.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
To measure my actual abilities and have a good refresher bedore the course to be able to manage new obstacles with a learn-focused ideology.
- What problem does it solve?
The overall link between HTML/CSS/JS and the interaction they have in the software world, or the Big Data.
- What did you learn?
I learned how GitHub is useful for teamwork, to be able to track changes and to cooperate within peers; how HTML and CSS are important but are the frameworks for the JS code wich permits the "normal" interaction between human - machine.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
